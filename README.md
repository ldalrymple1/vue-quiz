## Approach

This was my first time using Vue. I really enjoyed playing around with a new front-end framework other than React. I could draw lots of similarities between the two but actually found Vue much easier to understand, especially thanks to the docs which are awesome. I'm looking forward to building more web apps using Vue!

## Challenges
For some reason I found the timer really hard to stop. I ended up calling a set Interval function that is run when the user clicks on the start button. It checks every 50 miliseconds if the seconds in state have gone below 0 and if so the end of game screen should appear. This is probably quite buggy and not the best way to go about it.

I also spent more time than I should have trying to make the match between the backpack and the brand that had been selected.

## Wins 
Creating my first Vue app and just generally getting familiar with the syntax.
Experimenting by using Vue CLI which enabled me to quickly set up the project using npm.
